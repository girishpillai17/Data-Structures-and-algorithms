"""The main function, draw ruler, manages the construction of the entire ruler. Its arguments specify the total number of inches 
in the ruler and the major tick length.

The utility function, draw line, draws a single tick with a specified number of dashes 
(and an optional string label, that is printed after the tick).

The interesting work is done by the recursive draw interval function. This function draws the sequence of minor ticks within some interval, based upon the
length of the intervalâ€™s central tick."""
